# Variant-Pathogenicity-Classifier
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a human genetic variant is likely pathogenic or benign, using annotated data from the ClinVar database. The model was trained on over 3.4 million variants, leveraging biologically meaningful features like variant type, allele length difference, and gene symbol structure.
